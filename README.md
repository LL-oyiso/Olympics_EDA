# Olympics_EDA
An overview of the project

We are going to perform Exploratory Data Analysis which is an approach used to uncover insights, patterns and confirm assumptions using statistical summaries and graphical representations. Think of it as being given a sandbox (dataset) and set a tools (our various libraries) like a rake, pike and spade and digging through the sandbox to uncover gems which in this case would be different insights from our data. The dataset we will be working on is the Olympic Games containing records of games all the way from 1896, Athens Olympics to 2016, Rio Olympics.
